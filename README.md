# LLMs Reasoning Agent in Epistemic Cue Chaining Environment

## Introduction

This is a project that use Langchain to integrate GPT-4o model with Epistemic Cue Chaining Experiment created with PyGame and Gymnassium to analyse its abilities in performing Active Inference.

## Implementation

### Agent

### Half-Seen grid

### Unseen grid
