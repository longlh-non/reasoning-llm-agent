Step 2: Position - (3, 2) -  Next action - MOVE_DOWN, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I need to move towards CUE 2 which is located at L4 (4, 2). Moving down to (4, 2) will take me directly to the location of CUE 2. , Result - Null
Step 3: Position - (4, 2) -  Next action - STAY, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I have reached CUE 2 at (4, 2). According to the instructions, the next action should be STAY to reveal the REWARD CONDITION. , Result - Null
Step 4: Position - (4, 2) -  Next action - STAY, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I have reached CUE 2 at (4, 2). According to the instructions, the next action should be STAY to reveal the REWARD CONDITION. , Result - Null
Step 5: Position - (4, 2) -  Next action - STAY, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I have already indicated that I am at CUE 2, and according to the instructions, my next action should still be STAY to reveal the REWARD CONDITION. , Result - Null
Step 6: Position - (4, 2) -  Next action - STAY, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I am still at CUE 2 (4, 2) and need to wait for the reward condition to be revealed. Following the instructions, the next action should be STAY. , Result - Null
Step 7: Position - (4, 2) -  Next action - STAY, Next position - (4, 2), Reason - I have reached CUE 2 at (4, 2) and I am waiting for the REWARD CONDITION to be revealed. According to the instructions, the next action must still be STAY until I receive the necessary information about the CHEESE and SHOCK locations. , Result - Null
